This is a prototype project:

We modified one of Unity's sample projects, called Survival Shooter, to allow the player's heart rate to control the speed of the player's movement in the game.
For this version, two Player scripts were modified, and also, a new HeartBPM script was added to the Player object. 

Read the INSTRUCTIONS.docx to test or modify this game. There are a lot of useful information.
